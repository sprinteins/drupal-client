The most API resources are freely available to you, without having credentials:

* [Retrieving Data for your selection](#get-started-section/api-resources-and-workflow-steps--retrieving-data-for-your-selection)
* [Using temporary target-group selections](#get-started-section/api-resources-and-workflow-steps--using-the-playground-part-of-the-api-to-explore-the-possibility_60s-with-our-data)

In order to **process your target-group selection** further to dispatch-preparation or booking (see [this chapter](#get-started-section/api-resources-and-workflow-steps--using-the-authenticated-part-of-the-api-_28this-is-required-to-proceed-to-booking-or-planning_29)), you need to have an own user environment and credentials.

* for **Dispatch preparation**, please consult the [Print-Mailing Dispatch Preparation API](https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-dispatch-preparation-api#get-started-section/get-access)

# Environments

We offer two environments which may differ in their version and documentation

* Production environment (PROD)
  * use this [Documentation](https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-targeting-api)
* Test Environment (UAT)
  * use this [Documentation for UAT](https://developer.dhl.com/api-reference/print-mailing-targeting-api-uat)
  * serves as a sandbox
  * *Requests made to the test environment never affect productive systems and are not billed*.

See the servers drop-down menu in the [Reference Docs](#reference-docs-section/) for the environments URLs.
> There are two different technical specifications for both the production environment (PROD) and test environment (UAT). Updates will be available in UAT first. These updates then also appear with a time lag on PROD. You can see from the release notes of both documentations whether the technical specification for the UAT is more up-to-date than for the PROD.
