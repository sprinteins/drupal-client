  description: >-
    This API is designed to classify products based on their description and optionally on additional information into the categories of the Harmonized System (HS) of the World Customs Organization.
    In addition to the 6 digit HS standard, additional standards may be supported. Which systems are supported by a running instance of this API can be queried
    at the /classification-standards and /classifiers endpoints.

          Pre-specified codes to restrict the range of customs codes which
          can be returned by the API. For example ["02"] would ensure that
          the item can only be classified into HS Chapter 2. In this case
          "020100" would be a possibly returned classification, but "010500"
          would not be.
          
          It is possible to specify a list of possible codes with differing length and also ranges e.g. ["40", "4201", "6403-6406"].
          
          Note that the API understands the given codes from the perspective of
          the target classification standard. So if the target standard is
          for example "au-import" and the code "0101210021" is specified as
          an allowed code, it is expected that this code also refers to the
          Australian import standard and there is no translation being done.
          If a code from a different standard is available it can however be
          shortened to the common international level befor.

          Pre-specified codes to restrict the range of customs codes which
          can be returned by the API. For example ["02"] would ensure that
          the item can only be classified into HS Chapter 2. In this case
          "020100" would be a possibly returned classification, but "010500"
          would not be.

          It is possible to specify a list of possible codes with differing length and also ranges e.g. ["40", "4201", "6403-6406"].

          Note that the API understands the given codes from the perspective of
          the target classification standard. So if the target standard is
          for example "au-import" and the code "0101210021" is specified as
          an allowed code, it is expected that this code also refers to the
          Australian import standard and there is no translation being done.
          If a code from a different standard is available it can however be
          shortened to the common international level before.
